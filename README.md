# Python List Operations Demo

This project contains a simple Python script demonstrating basic list operations. It is intended as a learning example to showcase common list manipulation techniques in Python.

## Features

The script demonstrates the following list operations:
- Appending elements to a list
- Inserting an element at a specific index
- Extending a list with another list
- Removing elements by value
- Sorting a list
- Finding the index of an element

## How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Then run the script using the command:

```bash
python list.py
```

## Example Output

```
[10, 15, 20, 30, 40]
[10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]
[10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
[10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
Index of 30: 3
```

This output shows the list after each operation and the index of the element 30 in the final list.
